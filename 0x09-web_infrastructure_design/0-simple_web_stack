SERVER; refers to a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer and its client.
The role of a domain name is to uniquely identify a resource on the website.
The type of DNS record www in the www.foobar.com is a non-recursive query record because the address is specific.
The role of a web server is to use HTTP to respond to a client request mode over the world wide web.
The role of an application server is to link the operating system with external resources such as DBMS and the internet. It is a layer or framework that connects application development with database systems and the internet.
The role of the database in this case is to store data or information/resources required for the application electronically for the purpose of accessing, updating and managing them.
The server communicates with the clientâ€™s computer using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
This design uses only a single server, thus the SPOF issue in this case would be the failure of a single server which might lead to the application crashing or becoming unstoppable.
The downtime issues might arise due to network outage, hardware and software failures, as well as human errors during code deployment.
Scaling comes with fragmented databases  and possibility of disconnected servers which might lead to application failures.
